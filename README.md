# IoT Human – Following Car

## Introduction
Welcome to the **IoT Human – Following Car** project! This innovative project features an IoT-powered car that autonomously tracks and follows humans. By integrating advanced components and intelligent programming, this project exemplifies my ability to blend robotics and IoT seamlessly.

### Tech Synergy
This project showcases the synergy between robotics and IoT, creating a dynamic fusion of hardware and software. It highlights my capacity to synthesize diverse technologies into a cohesive system.

### Precision Tracking
Equipped with an Arduino Uno, a motor driver shield, and a servo motor, the car achieves exceptional accuracy in autonomously following human movement.

### Sensory Intelligence
The integration of ultrasonic and infrared sensors allows the car to detect obstacles, measure distances, and navigate complex environments with precision.

### Real-World Application
Beyond its technical prowess, this project demonstrates the practical applications of IoT-driven robotics in areas such as surveillance, assistance, and automation, making it a notable addition to my project portfolio.

## Components and Their Functions
- ***`Arduino Uno`***: The central processing unit of the project, responsible for interpreting sensor inputs and controlling motor outputs. Its versatility and ease of programming make it ideal for managing the car's operations.
- ***`Motor Driver Shield`***: Facilitates control of multiple motors by interfacing between the Arduino and TT gear motors, allowing precise speed and direction control for smooth movement.
- ***`Wheels and TT Gear Motors`***: Four wheels and TT gear motors provide mobility, enabling the car to make intricate turns while following a human.
- ***`Servo Motor`***: Manages steering control, allowing the car to autonomously adjust its direction based on sensor inputs to stay aligned with the human it follows.
- ***`Ultrasonic Sensor`***: Measures the distance between the car and the human, crucial for avoiding collisions and maintaining a safe following distance.
- ***`Infrared Sensor`***: Detects obstacles in the car's path, enabling it to navigate around objects and ensure smooth movement in complex environments.
- ***`18650 Li-ion Battery and Battery Holder`***: Powers the car, providing extended operation periods with rechargeable batteries for sustainability.
- ***`Male and Female Jumper Wires`***: Establish connections between components, ensuring reliable communication and functionality.
- ***`Acrylic Sheet`***: Serves as the car's chassis, providing structural support and a secure platform for mounting components.
- ***`DC Power Switch`***: Allows convenient control over the car's power supply, enhancing user experience and energy efficiency.
